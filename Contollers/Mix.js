            "description": "Ever since the movie, Shershaah was released, Kiara Advani and Sidharth Malhotra's massive fanbase has been rooting for them to become a couple and announce their relationship to the world. However, even though the duo has been dating for quite some time, none of them has spoken about it in front of the media. But, their social media PDAs, public outings and dinner dates show how much they are in love with each other.However, a few days back, rumours were rife that Sidharth and Kiara had parted ways for reasons best known to them. A source close to the couple had even mentioned to the media that they had fallen out of love and wouldn't meet each other anymore. The news about their breakup had devastated their fans. But, when Sidharth Malhotra had gone for Kiara's Bhool Bhulaiya 2 screening, their cute love-filled gestures had won our hearts, and everyone had wondered whether everything was fine between them."

            "description": "In a scene just before Amazon Prime’s Samaritan climaxes, the protagonist played by a worn and visibly old Sylvester Stallone tells an exuberant kid “The things is there is good and bad inside each one of us”. It is a rather declarative way of ending a film but given the film’s late narrative twist, it is also a neatly pulled-off message. But cinema isn’t just the messaging, but also the craft of leading you through a journey that makes the message palatable, even if unexpected. In Samaritan, no such thing happens as a film ripe with promise and casted perhaps to perfection, meanders pointlessly before turning around at the end, to reveal it had bright ideas all along, just not the tools to design a decent story around it. It is decent rescue act, loaded with an interesting moral quandary, but it appears in quantity far little, far too late.Samaritan is the story of the most obviously named white guy from Atlantic City – Joe Smith. Smith picks up garbage, wears a hoodie and keeps to himself. He is also an old man, an aspect of his character that the film does a poor job of exploring. Joe’s life is pre-dated by a famous feud between two superheroes –  the good one being Samaritan and the bad one called Nemesis. A fight to the end, we are told in the prologue, ended with the death of Nemesis. Samaritan has since gone missing too. Of course it has been clear all along, ever since the trailer for the film released that Stallone is the superhero out of commission. His withdrawal from playing saviour, however, isn’t exactly fleshed as much as it is argued over with the diction of someone who has just found what research is."

            "description": "As I was waiting for someone at a Delhi hotel recently, I saw a gentleman coming my way. He sat next to me and curiously asked about the laptop I was using. “It’s a Surface Laptop Studio,” I replied. “Does Microsoft make its own laptops?” He admitted he wasn’t aware of the Surface brand but told me he liked the form factor of the Surface Laptop Studio. “It’s different from my MacBook Pro,” said the man who introduced himself as the owner of an architectural firm. This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater. I have been using the Surface Laptop Studio for a few days, and I am in love with this device even though it is not perfect. Here is my review."

            "description": "o one will understand you or your body the way you do so make sure you listen to it, protect it, do good things for it and celebrate it,” they saidYoga is now the preferred choice of many, to stay fit, active and agile. It helps in numerous ways, be it in improving flexibility, strength and posture, or reducing stress and providing a sense of calm. Nutrition and diet are an important part of fitness along with physical exercise. On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or notAnshuka Parwani, a yoga expert, and Pooja Makhija, a nutritionist took to Instagram to talk about this dilemma that many face.Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that. On the other hand, if it feels like you need something to get a better start, follow that as a part of your routine.    "
