            "description": "After impressing fans and critics alike with her role of Hannah Baker, a troubled teenager in Netflix’s hit series 13 Reasons Why — a show that put the spotlight on mental health issues, bullying and gun violence —  Katherine Langford has only climbed the stairs of stardom.The Knives Out actor, who is currently attending the 75th Festival de Cannes in France, recently spoke with indianexpress.com ahead of her red carpet debut at the French Riviera. Her first look was a glittery custom Prada gown for the screening of Final Cut (Coupez!). Styled by Molly Dickson, Langford’s ensemble featured silver sequins and a sweeping train.The Cannes film festival has always been very special in my heart. To bring films, fashion and filmmakers together is special and exciting. It’s even more exciting, in a way, to be able to come together and celebrate films. [It is] the 25-year anniversary of L’oréal Paris sponsoring the festival, and so, it is a real privilege and honour and I am very excited to be here."

            "description": "For $29.99 a month, a website called PimEyes offers a potentially dangerous superpower from the world of science fiction: the ability to search for a face, finding obscure photos that would otherwise have been as safe as the proverbial needle in the vast digital haystack of the internet.A search takes mere seconds. You upload a photo of a face, check a box agreeing to the terms of service and then get a grid of photos of faces deemed similar, with links to where they appear on the internet. The New York Times used PimEyes on the faces of a dozen Times journalists, with their consent, to test its powers.PimEyes found photos of every person, some that the journalists had never seen before, even when they were wearing sunglasses or a mask, or their face was turned away from the camera, in the image used to conduct the search. PimEyes found one reporter dancing at an art museum event a decade ago, and crying after being proposed to, a photo that she didn’t particularly like but that the photographer had decided to use to advertise his business on Yelp. A tech reporter’s younger self was spotted in an awkward crush of fans at the Coachella music festival in 2011. A foreign correspondent appeared in countless wedding photos, evidently the life of every party, and in the blurry background of a photo taken of someone else at a Greek airport in 2019. A journalist’s past life in a rock band was unearthed, as was another’s preferred summer camp getaway."
